# About
This repository contains the code and dataset to my research on finding out which lifestyle variables are important for predicting the odds of an individual having diabetes or prediabetes. The model itself was a logistic regression model based on a dataset uploaded on Kaggle by Alex Teboul. The final logistic regression model consisted of 21 variables and had an AUC value of 0.8246 and an accuracy value of 72.65%.
